                When I originally finished college I was headed for a career in the field of education as a teacher. I had enthusiasm
                for learning as well as a passion for crafting experiences that would enhance the knowledge of my
                students. However not everything about education was for me and I spent several years learning to write code. I
                returned to school to earn a CS degree.  Now, instead of learning pedagogy I have become a lifetime
                learner of frameworks, libraries, and coding languages.  I absolutely love it - I write code almost every day and I hope to
                one day achieve the momentous goal of creating the perfect pizza tracker. Aside from programming I enjoy music, books, videgames and riding my bike.
